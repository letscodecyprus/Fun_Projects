# CSS Pumpkin


This is fun little haloween project fro 2017, where I didn't have the chance to crave a real pumpkin, so over the course of an hour, I made this one the IT way... with pure `CSS`!

It's far from perfect, but it was fun and I learned a ton of new stuff. Enjoy and Happy and Spooky Haloween!
