A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/julianengel/pen/pdJNeV.

 Every year for Haloween, we craved a pumpkin. This year, I didn't have a real one, so I got creative and made one.... in pure css :) Enjoy

It was created today, and is entirely made out of CSS, nothing else. It’s far from perfect, but I found it cute, and in the spirit of sharing… here it is :)
